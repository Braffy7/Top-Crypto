                <p>Bitcoin is the most well-known cryptocurrency. It was introduced to the public in 2009 by an anonymous developer or group of developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was initially designed and released as a peer-to-peer payment method using blockchain technology. Its popularity has inspired the development of many other cryptocurrencies. These competitors either attempt to replace it as a payment system or are used as utility or security tokens in other blockchains and emerging financial technologies.

                <p>At its core, Ethereum is a blockchain-based, decentralized global software platform. It can be used by anyone to create any secured digital technology they can think of. It has a token designed for use in the blockchain network, but it can also be used as a payment method. It natively supports smart contracts, which are the essential tool behind decentralized applications.3 Many decentralized finance (DeFi) and other applications use smart contracts in conjunction with blockchain technology. Vitalik Buterin, credited with conceiving Ethereum, published a white paper to introduce Ethereum in 2014.

                <p>Litecoin (LTC) is an alternative cryptocurrency created in October 2011 by Charles "Charlie" Lee, a former Google engineer. Litecoin was adapted from Bitcoin's open-source code but with several modifications. Like Bitcoin, Litecoin is based on an open-source global payment network that is not controlled by any central authority. Litecoin differs from Bitcoin in aspects like faster block generation rate and use of Scrypt as a proof of work scheme. It is considered to be among the first altcoins, derived from Bitcoin's original open-source code.
